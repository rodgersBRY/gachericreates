### Behind the Lens

Bird photography demands a different mindset: faster shutter, sharper eyes, and infinite patience. In this series, shot across several mornings in Nairobi National Park, I challenged myself to shift focus from the usual large mammals to the often-overlooked avian life — creatures that add movement, color, and music to every inch of the bush.

Armed with a telephoto lens and a pocket notebook for field observations, I tracked sunbirds, hornbills, and bee-eaters. I learned their patterns, listened to their calls, and discovered that their small stories are just as dramatic — and beautiful — as any big game narrative.

### The Story It Tells

"Birdsong Chronicles" is a tribute to the unsung heroes of the wild. These birds aren’t just decorative — they are ecological messengers, pollinators, seed-spreaders, and singers of seasonal change. The series is split between action shots (wings mid-flight, food captures) and quiet portraits that showcase detail and texture: feathers, eyes, posture.

The story here is one of presence. Of learning to look closer, listen longer, and realize that life is abundant in places we often overlook.

### What It Meant to Me

This project sharpened my observational instincts and expanded my understanding of storytelling scale. Photographing birds required me to slow down, go quiet, and adapt to faster, less predictable subjects. It made me a better technician — but more importantly, it made me a better witness

It also reminded me how rich Nairobi’s urban-wild interface really is. Even in a city park, wildness endures — and sings.
