### Behind the Lens

This series began as a technical challenge: could I capture the subtle shifts in mood and shadow as golden hour moved across the plains of the Maasai Mara? What started as a lighting experiment became a personal meditation on stillness, warmth, and the ephemeral beauty of dusk in the wild.

I spent several evenings shooting from the same few vantage points, watching how animals moved differently in the softness of the hour. I played with silhouettes, backlight, and dust-filtered rays — chasing moments that felt less like documentation and more like poetry.

### The Story It Tells

"Golden Hour in the Mara" isn’t centered on any one species or event. Instead, it’s a mood-driven narrative — an emotional landscape that flows from image to image. From herds of zebras crossing in the fading light to giraffes stretching skyward against a glowing backdrop, the series whispers, rather than shouts.

This is a story about transition: from day to night, tension to calm, and wild motion to rest. The soft, amber tones create a sense of dreamlike serenity, giving the viewer a chance to experience the Mara in its quietest power.

### What It Meant to Me

For me, this project redefined what makes a strong photograph. It’s not always the lion’s roar or the dramatic kill. Sometimes it’s the pause, the palette, the breath between moments. This series taught me to slow down, to trust light as a storytelling partner, and to appreciate the emotional language of the environment itself.

More importantly, it revealed a subtler side of the Mara — one that tourists often miss, but one that makes the ecosystem whole.
