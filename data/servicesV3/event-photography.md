### Service overview

Every event tells a story, and photography is the best way to preserve it. I approach each event with a documentary mindset — unobtrusive but intentional — capturing moments you noticed, and even more that you didn’t.

Whether it’s a corporate conference, private celebration, or intimate gathering, I deliver images that reflect the emotion, the people, and the vibe in every frame. You’ll receive a polished, high-quality collection that serves both as a keepsake and a communication tool for post-event sharing and branding.

### Our service includes

Full coverage for corporate, community, and private events, tailored to your schedule and venue.

Pre-shoot planning to align with your event flow, priorities, and style preferences.

On-site candid and staged moments, detail shots, and atmosphere coverage.

Quick-turnaround highlight sets for media or social use.

Optional post-event editing styles (journalistic, cinematic, or brand-aligned).
